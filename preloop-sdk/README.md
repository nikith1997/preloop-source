# Preloop SDK
This package provides a SDK to interact with the Preloop API, and additionally provides the methods required to write feature scripts using the "Inception" method. Preloop is
an intelligent feature platform that helps ML and AI teams move quicker and more efficiently, while enabling them to focus more on the science and productionization of their models,
and less on the data infrastructure.

# Installation instructions
Use pip to install the SDK. It's recommended to do so in a virtual environment.
```
pip install preloop-sdk
```

# Authentication
Use environment variables to store an API key generated in your account to authenticate with Preloop.
```
export PRELOOP_KEY_ID=<key_id>
export PRELOOP_SECRET=<secret>
```
