# Teams

Team's are used to logically group users within an org who share similar requirements of features and who would benefit from having access to other user's features and datasources. Teams are the second level of organization. A team can consist of multiple users, where the original creator of a feature or datasource can make modifications to their own, but not to those of others. 

## Roles

Roles are used at a team level as well. The roles here are a bit different compared to those assigned at the org level. A role is of two types:

    * owner
    * member 

Owners have the ability to add and remove users, change the name and descriptions of a team, and also delete teams. Beyond that, they have the same access privileges to other people's datasources and features.
