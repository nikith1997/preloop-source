# Pull Request Title Conformance Action

This composite action can be used by other repositories to check that Pull Requests titles follow the standard:

- PR title prefixed with a semantic tag
  - For example, `feat: my change`, `chore: my change`, `breaking: my change`, etc.
  - For more info, see <https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/>

- PR title contains shortcut or JIRA ticket reference
  - For example `my change [sc-111111]` or `my change [no ticket]`
